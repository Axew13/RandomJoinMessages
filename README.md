# RandomJoinMessages / RJM
This Minecraft Spigot plugin allows you to display a random message from a list to players when they log in to your server.
You can also set random messages for players logging in for the first time, and how this interacts with the regular log-in message.
Use this to display a nice variation of welcome-back style messages, or to give your players random hints!

Commands are `/rjm` to view version and `/rjm reload` to reload an updated config.yml file.

There are currently no permissions in the plugin, though op is required to use the `/rjm` command/sub commands.

Tested with Minecraft 1.19-1.20.1.
